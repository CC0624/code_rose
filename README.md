## About the project

This repository hosts the source code of a code rose for my girlfriend Xiao She. This work can be used to print the video to the terminal as a string.  

## Getting started
code rose currently supports Windows and Linux. Before executing python main.py, please maximize the full screen of the terminal window.

Args:

 --width:  a larger monitor can get a better display performance. For a 13.3-inch notebook, it is recommended that --width<=95, please adjust the value to the maximum value as much as possible (too large will cause one line of content to be input to another line, affecting the display effect) In order to obtain a higher resolution as much as possible.

--zip_password: password for zip file "pic.zip", please ask cc to get this password.

You can view the Valentineâ€™s Day gift by executing the following command in any of your current python environment:

```{.sourceCode .bash}
git clone https://github.com/CC0624/code_rose.git
cd code_rose/
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --width 90 --zip_password ****
```

Happy Valentine's Day!
